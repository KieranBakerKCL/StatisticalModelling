# 5CCM242A/6CCM242B - Statistical Modelling

Welcome to my githib repository which contains all the code relevent to the 5CCM242A/6CCM242B - Statistical Modelling course at KCL. Use these resources as a guide for how to write code and conduct statistical analysis in R. Note that the details of the analysis in this repo is far from exhaustive - statistics is a huge field, this course is an introduction to the key concepts to start!

Solutions to the theoretical tutorials can be found on [my webpage](https://sites.google.com/site/kieranbakerresources/home).

Questions from students can be addressed to kieran.baker@kcl.ac.uk.

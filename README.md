# 5CCM242A/6CCM242B - Statistical Modelling

This GitHub repository contains Quarto documents and other files relevant to the Statistical Modelling course at King's College London. The purpose of these resources is to help students understand some of the fundamental syntax in R, alongside how to perform analysis on data using the methods explained in the lectures and tutorials. A general comment about this course is that it is introductory, and there are many varieties of models and techniques that are not covered in the course.

> Practical 1: R Fundamentals, Loading in Data
>
> Practical 2: Exploratory Data Analysis, Simple and Multiple Regression
>
> Practical 3: Statistical Inference, Confidence and Prediction intervals, ANOVA, R-Squared
>
> Practical 4: Model Selection (Partial F-Tests, R-Squared, AIC, Predictive R-Squared, Stepwise selection)
>
> Practical 5: Two-way ANOVA, Optimisation with Quadratic Forms, and Logistic Regression.

Worksheets and solutions for the theoretical tutorials can be found on [my webpage](https://sites.google.com/site/kieranbakerresources/home).
